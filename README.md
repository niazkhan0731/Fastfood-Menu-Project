Welcome to our final project, conceived and nurtured during our tenure at Per Scholas! Our united team embarked on a journey into the dynamic realm of real-world development to forge an engaging Fast Food Menu Application. Fueled by the synergy of HTML, CSS, Python, and Flask, we harnessed the power of AWS Services, encompassing EC2, Cloud9, and MariaDB, to breathe life into this endeavor. Delve into our individual branches to witness the distinct contributions of each team member.
